# SF-ORB: Synthetic Cognitive Framework

SF-ORB is a synthetic cognitive framework implementing a multi-modal reasoning system inspired by philosophical traditions (Spinoza, Hume, Locke, Kant) integrated with Bayesian inference and geometric reasoning.

## Features

- **Four Minds Tribunal**: Epistemic reasoning across deductive, inductive, and intuitive logic seeds
- **Bayesian Engine**: Probabilistic inference for cognitive processes
- **HLSF Geometry**: High-level spatial field geometry for spatial reasoning
- **Vault System**: Knowledge storage and retrieval with apriori and posteriori components
- **Interface**: Orb window for visualization and interaction
